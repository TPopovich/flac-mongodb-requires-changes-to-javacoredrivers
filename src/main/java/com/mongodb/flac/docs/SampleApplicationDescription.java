 * Sample Application Description: the use case that we have embedded in the
 * test code is described below:
 * <p/>
 *
 * <p>Consider a military or government facility that needs to track access
 * to sensitive documents, it might have the following clearance levels:
 * <al>
 *     <li> TS - top secret</li>
 *     <li> S - secret</li>
 *     <li> C - classified</li>
 *     <li> U - unclassified</li>
 * </al>
 * </p>

 * compartmentalize further, in our use case we might see sci and another
 * term like TK.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally there might be release restrictions, e.g. NorthAmerica only.</p>
 *
 * <p>Given the above, wrt to security it can mean whatever is needed for
 * your application.  The FLAC implementation is </p>
 * <p>Note that this class is here to contain easy links to our sample application</p>
